Actually All newed.


<New>
class sqlite_insert_PersAddr{};

//sqlite3_finalized func.

<changed>
all iterators..  sqlite_insert_PersAddr::_it_pers, _it_addr.

<begfixed>
runtime error : Map/Set issue. -> iterator was wrong.
each class ,who need to use iterator, have to declarate and costumize IT.
Just same as Class Instance.
